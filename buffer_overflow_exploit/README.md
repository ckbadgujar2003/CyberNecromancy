## Overview

This project demonstrates a Buffer Overflow Exploit using the VulnServer application. Buffer overflow is a vulnerability where an attacker can overwrite the program's memory by sending more data than it can handle, leading to control over the application. This repository provides a step-by-step guide on how to exploit such vulnerabilities, bypass common security measures, and create exploits in different programming languages. This project is intended for educational purposes and aimed at beginners in cybersecurity.

## Introduction

The Buffer Overflow Exploit project aims to help cybersecurity enthusiasts understand how buffer overflows work by recreating a vulnerability using VulnServer. Through this guide, users will learn how to identify, exploit, and mitigate buffer overflow vulnerabilities using different programming languages like C/C++ and Nim. This project includes both a comprehensive report and a proof-of-concept video to illustrate the exploitation process.

## Requirements

- Operating System: 
  - Windows 10 (VM) for running VulnServer
  - Kali Linux (VM) for developing the exploit
- Tools:
  - Vulnerable Software: [VulnServer](https://thegreycorner.com/vulnserver.html)
  - Debugger (e.g., Immunity Debugger)
  - Nim Programming Language (for alternative exploit development)
  - Python or Metasploit tools for pattern generation

## Setup and Usage

1. **Download and Install VulnServer**:
   - Set up VulnServer on a Windows VM to recreate the vulnerability.
   - Install and configure Immunity Debugger for efficient debugging.

2. **Install Nim on Kali VM**:
   - Follow the setup instructions to install and configure Nim for exploit development.

3. **Establish a Network Connection**:
   - Ensure both Windows and Kali VMs can communicate. Use `ping` to verify connectivity or `nc` to check connection on port 9999.

4. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ckbadgujar2003/necr0mancer.git
   ```
   
5. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd buffer_overflow_exploit
   ```

## Exploit Details

### Vulnerability Description

The buffer overflow vulnerability in VulnServer is found in the 'TRUN' command, which fails to validate the input length, allowing an attacker to send excessive data that can overwrite the programâ€™s memory.

### Steps to Exploit:

1. **Identify the Vulnerability**:
   - Send inputs to the 'TRUN' command to find the length needed to cause a crash.

2. **Control EIP**:
   - Use a unique pattern to identify the offset at which EIP is overwritten.

3. **Redirect EIP to ESP**:
   - Overwrite EIP with an address that will jump to ESP, where the shellcode is stored.

4. **Generate Shellcode**:
   - Use `msfvenom` to create a payload and include a NOP sled for stable execution.

5. **Send Final Exploit**:
   - Deliver the crafted payload to the target machine and open a reverse shell using a handler.

### Developing Exploits:
- Create exploits in **C/C++** and **Nim** languages to demonstrate how buffer overflow can be achieved using different programming approaches.

## Common Obstacles

1. **Nim Modules Not Installed Properly**:
   - Follow the setup instructions to correctly configure Nim on Kali.

2. **Network Unreachable**:
   - Verify network configurations and ensure proper connectivity between Windows and Kali VMs.

3. **Firewall Blocking Connections**:
   - Modify Windows firewall rules to allow ICMP and TCP traffic on required ports.

4. **Reverse Shell Not Received**:
   - Ensure consistent IP addresses between shellcode generation and exploit execution.
