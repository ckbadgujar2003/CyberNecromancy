## Overview

This project demonstrates a Structured Exception Handler (SEH) Overflow Exploit. SEH overflow is a technique used to hijack the control flow of a vulnerable application by overwriting the exception handling structure. This repository provides an exlpoit and proof-of-concept (PoC) for educational purposes only, illustrating how SEH overflows can be exploited to gain control over an application.

## Introduction

The SEH Overflow Exploit project is designed for cybersecurity enthusiasts and researchers interested in understanding the mechanics of SEH overflows. The project showcases how attackers can leverage SEH overwrites to execute arbitrary code, bypassing security mechanisms like RTP (REal Time Protection).

## Requirements

- Operating System: Windows (version with known vulnerability for testing)
- Vylnerable Software: R 3.3.4 (32 bit)
- Tools: 
  - Debugger (e.g., Immunity Debugger)
  - Python (for exploit scripts)

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ckbadgujar2003/necr0mancer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
   ```bash
   cd seh_overflow_exploit
   ```

3. Exploit Development:
   The repository includes exploit scripts ranging from e1 to e7 that demonstrate the SEH overflow technique. The pdf file SEH_Overflow.pdf provides comprehensive details of the mechanism and step-by-step walkthrough for developing the exploit.

4. Running the Exploit:
   - Open the vulnerable application in a debugger.
   - Run the provided exploit scripts step by step to trigger the SEH overflow.
   - Observe the debugger to see how the SEH chain is overwritten and control is gained.

## Exploit Details

### Vulnerability Description

The SEH overflow occurs when a program does not properly validate user input, allowing an attacker to overwrite the SEH handler with a crafted value. This project includes a vulnerable application example and demonstrates the exploitation process.

### Steps to Exploit:

1. Identify the Vulnerability: Analyze the application to find an input that leads to an SEH overflow.
2. Craft the Payload: Create a payload that overwrites the SEH handler and provides a controlled jump to shellcode.
3. Trigger the Exploit: Send the payload to the vulnerable application and observe the results.
